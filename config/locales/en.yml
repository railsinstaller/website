      instructions: "Step 2: Instructions for MAC"
      instructions_1: Now that you've downloaded the kit let's get started!
      instructions_10: Once that's complete we can visit the application folder and start Rails server to see the site in our browser.
      instructions_11: Visit
      instructions_12: in your web browser to see the default Rails welcome page.
      instructions_13: The remaining steps will require you to have a text editor. There are various text editors you can use out there but I'll put one below that is fairly popular in the developer community.
      instructions_14: "Visit link to download:"
      instructions_15: Sublime Text
      instructions_16: "After downloading and installing Sublime Text you''ll need to install its command line functionality:"
      instructions_17: The first task is to make a symlink to subl. Assuming you've placed Sublime Text 2 in the Applications folder, and that you have a ~/bin directory in your path, you can run
      instructions_18: You can now visit the folder of your rails application and open your new rails app with Sublime Text
      instructions_19: Now that you have your rails demo app open in the text editor edit the
      instructions_2: Open the downloaded TAR file to begin the installation and follow the onscreen instructions to setup GIT. This process takes about 20 minutes so I would go grab a cup of coffee and come back!
      instructions_20: "file using the navigation panel. Once you''re there uncomment the following line of code by removing the "
      instructions_21: Next you'll need to visit the command line prompt and create a welcome controller for the index action.
      instructions_22: Now lets edit the welcome index.html which can be found under
      instructions_23: "and change the content to say something like the following:"
      instructions_24: Remember to SAVE that file after change.
      instructions_25: If you restart Rails server and visit
      instructions_26: you'll see the exact same page because Rails is still serving your index.html file in the public folder. You'll need to remove the file at
      instructions_27: within Sublime Text. Then when you refresh the browser you should see your new page!
      instructions_28: Now for the FINAL stretch, using version control and committing your changes to Github. First let's visit your Github account at
      instructions_29: sign up if you don't have one.
      instructions_3: Once installation is complete go ahead and open up Terminal under

      instructions_36: "Next we''ll create a new repository on Github, you can call it whatever you want but it''s best to keep it similar to our app titled "
      instructions_37: Finally we'll finish it off with the following commands to push your code to Git and Github
      instructions_38: Command Line
      instructions_39: Enter your Github.com credentials when prompted then press ENTER
      instructions_4: "Next we will run a few commands to make sure everything was setup correctly:"
      instructions_40: It's OFFICIAL, You've created your first Rails Project
      instructions_5: This will display what version of GIT you have.
      instructions_6: This will display information about your Ruby Version Manager environment.
      instructions_7: This will display information about your Ruby version to ensure everything was setup properly.
      instructions_8: This will display information about your Rails version to ensure everything was setup properly.
      instructions_9: Now that we've ensured everything is setup correctly we can now create a brand new rails application.
